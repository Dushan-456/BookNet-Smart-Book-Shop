## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) installed and running
* An API testing tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone Dushan-456/BookNet-Smart-Book-Shop
    cd BookNet-Backend
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variables. Replace the placeholder values with your own.

    ```env
    # .env.example

    # --- Database ---
    # Your PostgreSQL connection string
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/YOUR_DATABASE_NAME"

    # --- Server ---
    # The port your server will run on
    PORT=5000

    # --- Security ---
    # A long, random string for signing JWTs
    JWT_SECRET="your_super_long_and_random_secret_string_here"
    ```

4.  **Run database migrations:**
    This will create all the tables in your database based on the Prisma schema.
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```

5.  **Seed the database with initial data (optional but recommended):**
    This will populate your database with sample users, categories, and products.
    ```bash
    npm run seed
    ```

6.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The server will be running at `http://localhost:5000`.
